# The ”GamePal”

## Description

For our final project, we will develop a web application called “GamePal.” The user can use the application as a companion for a board game, to keep track of the player's score, turn, and wins. To get the application up and running, we'll need the player to choose the modules needed for their board game. Once the board game starts, the players can choose what their avatar will be, and their name. “GamePal” will allow the player to add/deduct points, roll the dice, start/stop/reset the timer, and end their turn resulting in the next player in line to do the same. For all of these features, we'll need the following.

## Data We'll Store

- Dice rolls, player names, and avatar
- (for RPG) Each player’s character, stats, and items
- (for a board game) points/score
- Data stored using?: Text lists, displayed tables (arrays)

## Main Menu

Choose between a number of players/ dice, timer, points, names, Name of game, Turn order (clockwise - counterclockwise), custom image/avatar, Amount to increment points

## In-Game

Player cards display the player’s name, avatar, and score, as well as buttons, to change score and end turn. Button to roll di(c)e and square(?) to display the result. Timer with buttons to control start/stop, adding time, and reset.
